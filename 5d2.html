      <h1>Affordances</h1>
      <p>Scissors afford to be gripped in one hand and gives the ability to stab through soft and thin objects when blades are unopened. Scissors tailors to left and right hand to allow majority of human beings to access. Scissors afford to cut through different thin materials such as paper and fabric. It also allows for concise precision to limit human error, which means individuals will be able to direct blades where to go. The sharp blades are away from handle for safety reasons. There are different sizes and sharpness for children and adults and it is compact in size to use in many different locations.</p>

      <h1>Constraints</h1>
      <p>One physical constraint of scissors is how individuals cannot cut through thick and or non-smooth materials, for example: wood, certain thick fabrics, and 3D objects. Another constraint is how the sharp blades can cause harm if used inappropriately. The last constraint is how constant use of the blades against the materials will eventually wear the stainless steel out.</p>
      <p>Cultural constraints include how scissors are universally made for the right hand, despite claiming to work for both. It is difficult and may cause discomfort for left-handed individuals to use “right-handed” scissors. Also, when passing scissors, it is known to be passed to the new user with the sharp blades facing away.</p>
